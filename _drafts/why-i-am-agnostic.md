One thing that come up often when you meet new people is what are your religious afiliations. Here, I usually make a untranslatable joke ("sou Ã  toa"), but sometimes a detailed answer is required.

I get blank stares when I say I am an agnostic- even though the reasons are not ground breaking to those in the skeptic community or faith apologetics. I believe (heh) it is because there exists a common image of atheists, and by extension agnostics, as angry, irated at God or frustated with religion people, who demean believers and judge them intelecually challenged because of their faith. Of course, _there are_ non-believers as such(likewise exists extremist believers) however I don't consider myself any of that. So I will list some of the _actual_ motives why no religion currently appeals to me. I don't claim to be an expert in all existing religions, but I will group all of their aspects(spirituality, life after death, non phisical entities, gods etc) together as the "supernatural".

1. Lack of supernatural in our daily lifes
There exits no (verified) supernatural activity in the everyday. If the supernatural is real, why does it seem to influence the natural world so little? Where's the showing of deities? And also, since, the supernatural has so many features why don't we see even sparse miracles?

Yeah, there are lots of people claiming to have seen a miracle but these claims always fall apart under scrutinity. Even if it were true that someone was healed with a prayer why don't we see happenings like in the antiguity(the Earth stops spinning, fire coming from the sky, the appearing of god etc)? Or the ones forseen in the future(the various accounts of apocalypse and the judment of the world)? What get passed as miracle is always a extension of what is doable today(healings) or just circunstances that get attibuited to the supernatural. What is also worthy of note is also our notion of supernatural activty changes with the time. In the past, _all_ natural phenomenons were work of higher beings(lightings, thunder, waves...). Once the knowledge is out, these things lose their mystical appearace.

2. Admitting the supernatural brings more questions than answers
As a programmer I am a huge fan of occam's razor. The simplest designs are always the most beautiful ones. And on contrary to popular notion, the universe is simpler without the supernatural.

Once there is enough knowledge to prevent god in the gap scenarios, adding a metaphisycal layer only adds complexity. We get large amounts of questions(why does God created evil? what really happens after death? why doenst gods show themselves? what makes a prayer be answered and other not?) and almost zero satisfactory answers. All religions can't seem to better explain the universe.

3. The holy books don't pass serious scrutinity
To me, that's also a giant elephant in the room. Everybody has heard of passages in holy books or collections of myths who upholds murder, rape, condones slavery, features gods doing immoral things and so on. All atempts to explain these in the light of truly good higher beings(or even in respect to coherence) are, quite frankly, plainly stupid. We get told thing are out of context, gods are absolute, or anything that "justifies" such passages. Also the "higher plan" of the universe and/or the plan of salvation (in the religions that features this) are all at least _weird_. You plant a tree knowing people would eat it in order to slay your own son afterwards? Mbombo felt an stomache and vomited the stars and the earth? 

4. The whole world doomed
That different religions don't agree with each other is common sense. However a particular instance is who gets saved. In the religions with danation(specially the biggest ones) everybody is going to hell. Or at least 99% of every person who has lived. Taking evangelic christinity as example: everybody before jesus(pre historic humans, ancient civilizations, well the whole human race except for jews) were off to hell. Asian, indian populations and people who hasnt heard of Christ after his descent, also to eternal fire. In the Middle Ages pretty much the whole world since they most followed by obligation a fashion of catholic christiniaty that features indulgences, with burning and domination by fear. More currently, everybody since the The Age of Enlightenment who questions religions, or is a non believer, is condemend too. Ah, and of course, every single person(even if they are Ghandi-like) who happened to believe another religion as the right one.

Those are my reasons but as said, current: so if I ever see any religion that explains our universe better than not having a religion, of course I will consider it.
