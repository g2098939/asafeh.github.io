Have you wondered why mediocre content is so popular? Cliche movies; same-old-plot, 1-dimensional-character books; lame sitcoms; pop music; etc. Why is that?

This could be answered with a hand-wave, "mediocre people like mediocre things", but this response doesn't have much depth. What to say about "intellectual" people who consume uninspired media? There exits a fair share of perfectly reasonable people who, at night, sit in front of a soap opera; or _nerds_ who read comics books(nothing more banal than a whole canon of stories where the characters announce their current actions and the good wins by default, amirite?).

In my opinion, the main reason is that everybody needs a mindless distraction. Nobody can't stay in a thinkative frame of mind all the time; people get to recharge with an activity that won't challenge their reasoning-be it a cheap romance or a TV show.

The thing I don't have a clue is why people would go as far as praising Dan Brown's novels, though.
